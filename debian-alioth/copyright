The BRL-CAD libraries provide their headers in the
include/ directory as well as all of the directories that begin with
the prefix "lib" in the src/ directory (e.g. src/librt/).  All of
BRL-CAD's libraries, applications, and any content lacking a license
specification are covered by the terms of the LGPL.

Most of BRL-CAD's build infrastructure including files required by the
GNU Build System (such as the configure.ac and all Makefile.am files),
a variety of scripts located in the misc/ and sh/ directories, and the
testing infrastructure (scripts and resources) are provided either
under the BSD license or are in the public domain.  Similarly, most of
the geometric models, images, and other data resources are also
provided under the BSD license.
