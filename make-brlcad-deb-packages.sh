# This file name: make-brlcad-deb-packages.sh
#
# This file was copied from BRL-CAD sh/make_deb.sh in April 2013 to
# start the out-of-tree semi-official BRL-CAD Debian package project.
# The goal of this project is to become the official Debian BRL-CAD package source.
#
# The original package maintainer for this project is Tom Browder
# <tom.browder@gmail.com> who introduced himself to the current Debian
# BRL-CAD package maintainer, Giuseppe Iuculano
# <giuseppe@iuculano.it>.  The current Debian project is inactive and
# has not been tended since 2009.  Tom also presented himself to the
# Debian maintainers group to whom the package belongs
# (science-maintainers) and stated his intentions to co-maintain the
# package and get a Debian Maintainer to sign his public key.
#
# The original file has been modified to (1) satisfy Debain packaging
# policy, (2) work with a cmake configuration and build outside the
# BRL-CAD source tree, and (3) respect the desires of the BRL-CAD
# developers when they do not conflict with Debian policy.
